# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'digital signatures'
BEGIN:ab
A digital signature is used to ensure the authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of data sent over a network.  The idea is that a key-pair is created by a sender, one being secret (or private) and the other being public (advertised to all).  So if communicator A wants to communicate with B, they encrypt their information with their own secret key which means that when B receives data from "A" because they use A's public key to decrypt the data, they are sure that the information has come from A.  The digital signature also involves a hashing function (to manage file size) which is available to both parties.  The hashing process occurs prior to the sender encrypting the data with their private key.  The receiver therefore uses the sender's public key to decrypt, leaving a hash.  And, also performs a hash function on the original data - comparing the two results.  If they match, they can be quite confident that data has not been manipulated in transit.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities (eg those faced by RC4)'
BEGIN:ac
One of the vulnerabilities of symmetric key algorithms is that if someone controls the network between the communicators, they will be able to impersonate each side of the communicators.  For example the Diffie Helman algorithm, is a method used to ensure both parties have the same 'secret key', and that no one in the public space know's what this secret key is (I won't go into how this works).  However, if A was communicating with B, it is possible for the "Man in the Middle" to pretend to be A (so that A believes they are communicating (directly) with B) and to pretend to B so that B believes they are communicatin (directly) with A.  However, the person forwards all information to A and B and is therefore privvy to all data that is passed/sent.  The remedy for this kind of attack is to use an Asymmetric key cryptographic algorithm.  This is essentially the digital signature, where everyone generates their own private and public key pair (such that each public key can decrypt the data of the data encrypted with the matching private key.  Therefore, if A wants to communicate with B, A can also encrypt the data with their secret key, so when B decrypts it B can be sure that it has come from A (and not some person in the 'middle').

# Question 'ad': Write not more than 250 words about any of the items on the timeline at https://www.feistyduck.com/ssl-tls-and-pki-history/
BEGIN:ad
One of the key components of the Diffie Hellman algorithm is the use of a large prime number; used for the generation of a common (to both parties) secret key.  The degree of security offered by this algorithm depends in large part on the difficulty solving the ‘discrete logarithm problem’ (very difficult).  The vulnerability came from millions of HTTPS, VPN and SSH servers using the same prime number.  This meant that man in the middle attacks could choose to downgrade the TLS connection to 512 bit (thus read the exchanged data) and then through the use of significant computing power eventually unlock the prime number and data.  However, from then (given the same prime number was always used) it would only take a short time.  This was addressed though most browsers increasing the minimum bit connection standard to either 768 bit or 1024.  This made solving such a problem infeasible.
