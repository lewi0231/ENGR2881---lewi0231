## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language creates a network socket and binds it to a network address
ab=t
# Question 'ac': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language requires a network address, to be able to create a socket.
ac=f
# Question 'ad': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can be used to receive data from sockets.
ad=t
# Question 'ae': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language can limit how many connections a server can have queued.
ae=t
# Question 'af': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language creates a new socket for each received connection.
af=t
# Question 'ag': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can be used to write data to a socket.
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language closes a network socket.
