## Name and describe five reliability challenges for computer networks, referring to the network layers at which these challenges either arise, or are solved.
# Question 'cv': Reliability Challenge #0
cv=Transmitting raw data (binary) efficiently and effectively.  For instance, to avoid a stream of 1's or 0's (which can impact the reliability of the data through) the PHYSICAL LAYER utilises data encoding methods such as 4b/5b in order to ensure that there is regular switching between 1's and 0's.  This also ensures that clock recovery is occuring (i.e., timing of the receiving host and sender are in sync).
# Question 'cw': Reliability Challenge #1
cw=In order to check that transmitted data is error free, error checking methods such as a checksum algorithm or CRC (cyclic redundancy check) are utilised at the DATA LINK layer to determine if a frame needs to be resent and / or corrected (if possible).
# Question 'cx': Reliability Challenge #2
cx=
# Question 'cy': Reliability Challenge #3
cy=
# Question 'cz': Reliability Challenge #4
cz=
# Question 'da': Reliable delivery of streaming video 
BEGIN:da
END:da
# Question 'db': In which layer is security normally implemented in the OSI layered network model? Choose two other layers, and suggest how security might be implemented in each of those layers instead.
